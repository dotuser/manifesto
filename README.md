# trash.town
`relax.reuse.reboot`

## what is trash.town?
### a place to socialize
as a tilde server, the primary goal is to be a place to socialize and be with friends

### an installation art project
many tildes run as virtual instances on cloud services; trash.town will not. it will be a physical computer existing in a physical space and will be a source of physical and digital art

### a statement on reuse
e-waste is becoming more and more of a problem every day. trash.town will fight against the idea that a conputerâ€™s life ends because of being outdated. a conputer can have life breathed into it if we are creative about our solutions.
